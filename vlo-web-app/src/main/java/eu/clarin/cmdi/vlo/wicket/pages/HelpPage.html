                <h1>CLARIN Virtual Language Observatory: Help</h1>

                <p>
                    The Virtual Language Observatory (VLO) faceted browser was developed 
                    within CLARIN as a means to explore linguistic resources, services 
                    and tools available within CLARIN and related communities.
                    Its aim is to provide an easy to use interface, allowing for a 
                    uniform search and discovery process for a large number of resources
                    from a wide variety of domains and providers.
                </p>

                    <a target="_blank" wicket:id="moreInfo" href="">VLO page on the CLARIN website</a>.
                    For answers to common questions about the VLO, please consult the 
                    <a href="http://www.clarin.eu/faq-page/275">FAQ</a>.

                <h2>Faceted browsing</h2>
                <p>
                    The VLO search interface presents a number of <em>facets</em>, 
                    for each of which a value can be selected in order to narrow down
                    the selection of displayed records. For example, to only include
                    records that relate to Spain as a country, open the facet <em>Country</em>
                    and select the value <em>Spain</em>. Notice that next to each available value,
                    a number is displayed that indicates the number of records within
                    the current selection that contain that value, in other words the number
                    of remaining records should that value be selected.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Only the values that occur in the current selection (that is, the
                    records that match the already selected values and the optional
                    textual query (see <a href="#syntax">below</a>)) are shown. The VLO shows up to ten of the most 
                    frequently occurring values for each facet when you click on the
                    facet name. If there are more then ten available values, there
                    is a link labeled <em>more...</em>, which leads to a pop-up showing
                    all available values (given the current selections), than can be
                    filtered textually and sorted either alphabetically or by number of
                    matching records. It is also possible to search for facet values
                    by typing (part of) a value in the filter box below the facet name 
                    and above the facet values (<em>'Type to search for more'</em>)
                    in the panel next to the search results.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Facets that do not have any matching records given the current
                    selection will not be displayed in the facets panel in the
                    VLO search interface.
                </p>

                <h2 id="syntax">Search syntax</h2>
                <p>
                    In addition to navigating the resources by means of the selection
                    of facet values, the VLO faceted browser also allows for searching
                    by means of <strong>textual queries</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Such queries are to be entered
                    in the large <strong>text box</strong> at the top of the main page or faceted
                    browsing page with the button labeled 'Search' next to it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In its simplest form, a search query consists of one or more
                    terms, separated by a space character. Such queries result
                    in the retrieval of all documents that have one or more occurrences
                    of <em>all</em> of the included search terms. In other words,
                    an <strong>AND</strong> operator is implied by default.
                </p>
                <h3>Advanced querying</h3>
                <p>
                    It is possible to construct a more specific query by means of
                    a set of <strong>syntax features</strong> that can be processed 
                    by the VLO. The supported syntax is that of the
                    <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html">Lucene Query Parser</a>
                    <sup><a href="#noteedismax" id="refedismax">1</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Lucene Query Parser syntax allows for the following
                    <strong>boolean operators</strong>: 'AND', 'OR', 'NOT', '+'
                    and '-'. It also allows for <strong>grouping</strong>
                    of terms by means of parenthesis. 
                    Terms can be combined into <strong>phrases</strong> by means
                    of double quote characters.
                </p>

                The following <strong>examples</strong> illustrate the usage of these operators.
                Click any of the following examples to perform that query 
                on the actual data currently in the VLO:
                <ul>
                    <li><a class="example-query" href="search/?q=German%20AND%20acquisition">German AND acquisition</a> (all records that match both terms)
                        <ul>
                            <li><a class="example-query" href="search/?q=German%20acquisition">German acquisition</a> is an equivalent query</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><a class="example-query" href="search/?q=Myanmar%20OR%20Birma%20OR%20Burma">Myanmar OR Birma OR Burma</a> (all records that match at least one of these terms)</li>
                    <li><a class="example-query" href="search/?q=newspaper+AND+%28Czech+OR+Slovak%29">newspaper AND (Czech OR Slovak)</a> (all records that match the term 'newspaper' and at least one of the terms 'Czech' or 'Slovak')</li>
                    <li><a class="example-query" href="search/?q=Portuguese+-Brazil">Portuguese -Brazil</a> (all records that match 'Portuguese' but do not have an occurrence of 'Brazil')
                        <ul>
                            <li><a class="example-query" href="search/?q=Portuguese+NOT+Brazil">Portuguese NOT Brazil</a> is an equivalent query</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><a class="example-query" href="search/?q=%22sign+language%22+AND+%28Sweden+OR+Finland%29">&quot;sign language&quot; AND (Sweden OR Finland)</a> (all records that match the phrase 'sign language' and at least one of the terms 'Sweden' or 'Finland')</li>

                </ul>
                <h3>Targeting fields</h3>
                <p>
                    In addition to the logical operators, the syntax also allows
                    for search for occurrences of a term within a <strong>specific field</strong>,
                    such as language or modality. To do so, enter the name of the
                    field and the term to search for, separated by a semicolon.
                    The asterisk ('*') can be used to achieve partial matches.
                    Quotes are required to match a term that contains spaces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The following <strong>field names</strong> are available: 
                    language, country, continent, modality, genre, subject, format,
                    organisation, resourcetype, keyword, resources.
                    <br />
                </p>

                Click any of the following <strong>examples</strong> to perform that query 
                on the actual data currently in the VLO:
                <ul>
                    <li><a class="example-query" href="search/?q=resourcetype:%22Linguistic+corpora%22">resourcetype:"Linguistic corpora"</a> (equivalent to selecting this value below the 'Resource Type' facet)</li>
                    <li><a class="example-query" href="search/?q=language:Sign">language:Sign</a> (all records with a language name that contains the word 'sign')</li>
                    <li><a class="example-query" href="search/?q=country:%28Belgium+-Netherlands%29">country:(Belgium -Netherlands)</a> (all records with Belgium as country but not also Netherlands)</li>
                    <li><a class="example-query" href="search/?q=country:Finland+AND+language:Swedish+AND+NOT+language:Finnish">country:Finland AND language:Swedish AND NOT language:Finnish</a> (records in Finland with resources in the Swedish language but not in Finnish)</li>
                    <li><a class="example-query" href="search/?q=format:video/*">format:video/*</a> (all records with video resources)</li>
                    <li><a class="example-query" href="search/?q=resources:%5B5+TO+*%5D">resources:[5 TO *]</a> (all records with at least 5 resources)</li>
                </ul>
                <p> 
                    A <strong>full overview</strong> of syntax features, including
                    options for fuzzy search, ranges, and term boosting, can be found at the
