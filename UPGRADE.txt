----------------------------
General upgrade instructions
----------------------------

Quick overview of the upgrade steps (for details see DEPLOY-README)

- Unpack the VLO distribution tarball

- Go to the 'war' directory
- Run the 'unpack-wars.sh' script in that directory
  (OR execute the following steps manually:
	- Unzip the vlo-solr-#.##.war in a new 'solr' directory
	- Unzip the vlo-web-app-#.##.war in a new 'vlo' directory
	- Recursively assign ownership of the entire unpacked distribution to the
	appropriate user, i.e. 'vlouser' on catalog.clarin.eu)

- In the 'config' directory, inspect VloConfig.xml and the data roots 
configuration file that is included into this file by means of XInclude. It is
advised to perform a diff between the old and new versions of these files.
Depending on configuration preferences, you may want to copy settings from the
old configuration to the new one.

- Stop the Tomcat or at least the VLO web app and Solr applications
- Replace the 'current' symlink with a link to location of the new VLO directory

- If needed, flush the Solr index (by removing the data directory's content)
- In 'bin', run the importer using the updated configuration file:
    ./vlo_solr_importer.sh -c ../config/VloConfig.xml


-----------------------------
Upgrading from 3.4.x to 4.0.0
-----------------------------

This version of the VLO is based on CMDI 1.2, and no longer processes
CMDI 1.1. Therefore make sure that all metadata presented to the importer
is CMDI 1.2.

There are two additions to the VloConfig.xml file:
    - "primaryFacetFields" has a number "primaryFacetField" values that define
    which fields are shown at first in the front end.
    - "lrSwitchboardBaseUrl" defines the base URL of the Language Resource
    Switchboard, which is used to create a link in the resources section of the
    record page.

Normally the default values can be adopted for both of these.

There are no changes in the Solr schema, so the existing index can be kept.

-----------------------------
Upgrading from 3.4.0 to 3.4.1
-----------------------------

Maintenance release without the need to changes the configuration. However,
optionally the newly added statistics reporter can be configured for use. To
do so, follow these steps:
    - Copy the configuration.properties file to a stable location and edit the
    values to match the current environment. Currently, the reporter allows for
    reporting by means of an XML report file and/or by sending data to a 
    (remote) statsd server. This behaviour can be toggled by means of the 
    configuration properties.
    - Schedule the following command to be run after the importer completes:

        ${VLO_DIR}/bin/statistics/start.sh ${SITEMAP_CONFIG_PROPS_FILE}

(See the README file in bin/statistics for more information)

-----------------------------
Upgrading from 3.3.x to 3.4.x
-----------------------------

* A set of 'availability' values needs to be configured in VloConfig.xml. This
determines which values are shown for the availability facet in the web app,
and also allows for the setting of a description and display value. An example
configuration is given in the following snippet:

    <availability>
        <availabilityValue value="PUB">
            <displayValue>Public</displayValue>
            <description>Publicly available resources</description>
        </availabilityValue>
    </availability>

The default VloConfig.xml file is pre-configured for use in production and
generally does not need to be altered.

* The Piwik tracker is now configurable via context parameters. Set the 
following parameters according to your preferences:

    <Parameter 
        name="eu.clarin.cmdi.vlo.piwik.enableTracker" 
        description="'true' or 'false', defaults to 'false'"
        value="true"/>

    <!-- Further piwik parameters can be skipped if enableTracker is false -->

    <Parameter 
        name="eu.clarin.cmdi.vlo.piwik.siteId" 
        description="defaults to '3'"
        value="3"/> <!-- '1' for testing/beta, '3' for production -->
    
    <Parameter 
        name="eu.clarin.cmdi.vlo.piwik.host" 
        description="defaults to 'https://stats.clarin.eu/'"
        value="https://stats.clarin.eu/"/>
    
    <Parameter 
        name="eu.clarin.cmdi.vlo.piwik.domains" 
        description="defaults to '*.vlo.clarin.eu'"
        value="*.vlo.clarin.eu"/> <!-- should match public hostname -->

See <https://stats.clarin.eu> for configuration details per environment.

* Notice that the VLO importer script has an heap space maximum size that has
been increased to 4 Gb (see bin/vlo_solr_importer.sh). This can be configured
by means of the newly added "VMOPTS" variable in the script file.

* There have been changes to the Solr configuration, so make sure to run or use
a fresh import started with a clean index.

* _Optionally_ configure the VLO sitemap generator, which can be found in 
bin/sitemap-generator:
    - Prepare a target directory for the sitemap file(s)
    - Copy the configuration.properties file to a stable location and edit the
    values to match the current environment
    - Schedule the following command to be run after the importer completes:

        ${VLO_DIR}/bin/sitemap-generator/start.sh ${SITEMAP_CONFIG_PROPS_FILE}

    - Configure your web server to serve the contents of this directory via a 
    stable public URL
    - Register the sitemap URL with Google and/or other search engines
(See the README file in bin/sitemap-generator for more information)


--------------------------
Upgrading from 3.2 to 3.3
--------------------------
* Take note of the change in VloConfig.xml which moves the data roots definition
out of VloConfig.xml by means of XInclude. The configuration file now gets
prepared for deployment environments at build time, so it is no longer necessary
to copy over old configuration values in all cases.

* Decide whether hierarchies should be indexed and displayed, and set the new
'processHierarchies' configuration element accordingly (true/false). This 
governs the behaviour of both the importer (will simply skip the 'update 
hierarchies' step if set to false) and the front end (will not display hierarchy
related UI components).

* In the context fragment for the VLO web application, ADD the following 
attribute to the <Context> root element:

   sessionCookiePath="/"

and, if set, REMOVE any "crossContext" parameter.
 
---------------------------
Upgrading from 3.1 to 3.2
---------------------------
* Take note of the following changes in VloConfig.xml:

- 'facetConceptsFile' now defines the location of the facet/concept mapping 
definition on disk; to use the default bundled definition, leave it empty. 
Before this used to have the value '/facetConcepts.xml' which will no longer be
valid - it can safely be replaced with either the empty string or 
'facetConcepts.xml' to use the file in the same directory as VloConfig.xml.

- 'languageLinkPrefix' element has been REPLACED by 'languageLinkTemplate';
remove the former and add the following to existing configurations:

	<languageLinkTemplate>https://infra.clarin.eu/content/language_info/data/{}.html</languageLinkTemplate>

- 'languageNameVariantsUrl' and 'licenseAvailabilityMapUrl' are now required
mapping configuration elements. So the following should normally be added:

    <languageNameVariantsUrl>/LanguageNameVariantsMap.xml</languageNameVariantsUrl>   
    <licenseAvailabilityMapUrl>/LicenseAvailabilityMap.xml</licenseAvailabilityMapUrl>

- optional 'showResultScores' element, defaults to false. Should be false except
when debugging result ranking.

- The facet field 'availability' is now available

* Be aware that the default maximum heap space of the importer has been
increased from 2GB to 3GB (by means of a change in bin/vlo_solr_importer.sh).

---------------------------
Upgrading from 3.0.x to 3.1
---------------------------

* (For stable version) Update the external service running at <http://infra.clarin.eu/
service/language/info.php> to select the 'languageCode' facet using ISO639-3 language 
codes, e.g. <http://catalog.clarin.eu/vlo/search?fq=languageCode:code:nep> for 'nep'. 
Contact Sander Maijers <sander@clarin.eu> for more information.

* Take note of the following changes in VloConfig.xml:
- 'imdiBrowserUrl' element has been removed
- 'organisationNamesUrl' element has been added (should normally have 
'/OrganisationControlledVocabulary.xml' as its value)
- the 'language' facet has been replaced with 'languageCode'; the latter replaces the
former in the 'facetField', 'simpleSearchFacetField' and 'searchResultField' elements

* Flush the solr index (remove the data directory) and run a new import or copy the
beta index over if it is based on a recent 3.1 import.

---------------------------
Upgrading from 3.0 to 3.0.1
---------------------------

No additional actions required, the existing Solr index can be kept

---------------------------
Upgrading from 2.18 to 3.0
---------------------------

* In version 3.0, the context parameters for the VLO web application have changed, see
the file META-INF/context.xml for examples. The following parameters are now being
processed:	

- eu.carlin.cmdi.vlo.config.location
	Optional but recommended. Should point to the location of VloConfig.xml that
	should be used. Replaces The previously available parameter 'externalConfig', which is
	no longer supported.

- eu.carlin.cmdi.vlo.solr.serverUrl
	Optional. Configures the base URL of the SOLR instance to connect to.
	Usage is not recommended, instead configure the Solr URL via VloConfig.xml (see 
	below).

* New options have been added to the shared VLO configuration file VloConfig.xml 
(in vlo-3.0/config):

- The 'length' attributes in list elements can be removed

- The Solr endpoint has changed because it is now multicore. Change for example:

	<solrUrl>http://localhost:8084/vlo_solr/</solrUrl>
    
into

	<solrUrl>http://localhost:8084/vlo_solr/core0/</solrUrl>

This also applies to the eu.carlin.cmdi.vlo.solr.serverUrl context parameter (see above).

- The following elements should be added:

	<!-- begin added in 3.0 -->

	<collectionFacet>collection</collectionFacet> 

	<simpleSearchFacetFields>
		<simpleSearchFacetField>language</simpleSearchFacetField>
		<simpleSearchFacetField>resourceClass</simpleSearchFacetField>
		<simpleSearchFacetField>genre</simpleSearchFacetField>
		<simpleSearchFacetField>nationalProject</simpleSearchFacetField>
	</simpleSearchFacetFields>

	<!-- Fields shown in expanded search results on the search page -->
	<searchResultFields>
		<searchResultField>name</searchResultField>
		<searchResultField>country</searchResultField>
		<searchResultField>languages</searchResultField>
		<searchResultField>modality</searchResultField>
		<searchResultField>subject</searchResultField>
		<searchResultField>genre</searchResultField>
		<searchResultField>organisation</searchResultField>
		<searchResultField>collection</searchResultField>
		<searchResultField>nationalProject</searchResultField>
	</searchResultFields>

	<!-- Fields ignored in the record page -->
	<ignoredFields>
		<ignoredField>format</ignoredField>
	</ignoredFields>

	<!-- Fields shown as technical fields in the record page -->
	<technicalFields>
		<technicalField>id</technicalField>
		<technicalField>dataProvider</technicalField>
		<technicalField>metadataSource</technicalField>
		<technicalField>_landingPageRef</technicalField>
		<technicalField>_searchPageRef</technicalField>
		<technicalField>_contentSearchRef</technicalField>
		<technicalField>_lastSeen</technicalField>
		<technicalField>_componentProfile</technicalField>
	</technicalFields>

	<!-- end added in 3.0 -->

- The element 'facetfield' should be replaced with new values:

	<!-- begin changed in 3.0 -->

	<facetFields>
		<facetField>language</facetField>
		<facetField>resourceClass</facetField>
		<facetField>continent</facetField>
		<facetField>country</facetField>
		<facetField>modality</facetField>
		<facetField>genre</facetField>
		<facetField>subject</facetField>
		<facetField>format</facetField>
		<facetField>organisation</facetField>
		<facetField>nationalProject</facetField>
		<facetField>keywords</facetField>
		<facetField>dataProvider</facetField>
	</facetFields>

	<!-- end changed in 3.0 -->

* The location of the Solr index data directory is now governed through a java system
property 'solr.data.dir'. Add the following to ${catalina.home}/bin/setenv.sh:

	export JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Dsolr.data.dir=/lat/webapps/vlo/solr/data-beta"

Substitute the directory with the actual desired location of the index data. The
parent directory has to exist and should be writable by the Tomcat user.

---------------------------
Upgrading from 2.17 to 2.18
---------------------------

* In version 2.18 of the VLO, the URL mapping has been changed. To prevent
existing references and bookmarks from breaking, add rewrite rules to the
HTTP server to achieve the following mappings:

[TODO: Define actual mod_rewrite rules and document here]

- {vlobase}/?wicket:bookmarkablePage=:eu.clarin.cmdi.vlo.pages.ShowResultPage&docId={docId}
	-> {vlobase}/record?docId={docId}

- {vlobase}/?wicket:bookmarkablePage=:eu.clarin.cmdi.vlo.pages.ShowAllFacetValuesPage&selectedFacet={facet}
	-> {vlobase}/values/{facet}

In both case all additional GET parameters SHOULD be kept.

Next to the URL mapping, the XML parameter file has undergone some changes:

    <!-- Sets the maximum number of page instances which will be stored in the application scoped second level cache for faster retrieval -->
    <pagesInApplicationCache>40</pagesInApplicationCache>
    
    <!-- Sets the maximum size (in KILOBYTES) of the File where page instances per session are stored. -->
    <sessionCacheSize>10000</sessionCacheSize>

Has been added to tune the Wicket page cache. The first parameter allows you
to set the size of the application wide cache holding pages. The second parameter
denotes the size of the cache (in kilobytes) associated with a session. The values
listed above are the Wicket defaults.

Other changes in the parameter file:
- maxFileSize and use MaxFileSize have been integrated into one parameter:
  
  maxFileSize

  If equal to 0, no upper limit to the size of metadata input files will be 
  applied.

- maxDaysToLife has been renamed into maxDaysInSolr

- VloHomeLink has been renamed into homeUrl

- helpUrl has been added; a link to a help page.

- The facetConceptsFile parameter, referencing the facetConcepts.xml file, 
  has been added also. This is part of the effort of making parameterised 
  instantiation of the VLO possible.

- Also, the facetOverviewLength parameter has been added. This parameter controls
  the listing of facets on the search page.

- Similar to 'useMaxFileSize' the expectReverseProxy parameter has been removed

Finally, 

    <cqlEndpointFilter>http://cqlservlet.mpi.nl/</cqlEndpointFilter>
    
    <cqlEndpointAlternative>http://cqlservlet.mpi.nl/</cqlEndpointAlternative>

add the possibility of creating a filter for endpoints.
